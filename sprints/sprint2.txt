Sprint 2: Collaborative Filtering Implementation

Objective:
Implement a collaborative filtering system that can provide personalized movie recommendations based on user ratings.

Requirements:

1. Collaborative Filtering Core:
   - Implement a CollaborativeFiltering class with methods:
     * __init__(self, k_neighbors=5): Initialize with number of neighbors
     * fit(self, user_movie_matrix): Process rating data
     * predict_user_based(self, user_id, movie_id): Predict rating using user-based CF
     * predict_item_based(self, user_id, movie_id): Predict rating using item-based CF
     * recommend_movies(self, user_id, n=5, method='user'): Generate recommendations

2. Similarity Computation:
   - Implement user-user similarity calculation
   - Implement item-item similarity calculation
   - Use appropriate similarity metrics (e.g., cosine similarity)
   - Handle sparse rating matrices efficiently

3. Prediction Methods:
   - User-based collaborative filtering:
     * Find similar users
     * Weight ratings by similarity
     * Handle cold start problems
   - Item-based collaborative filtering:
     * Find similar items
     * Weight ratings by similarity
     * Handle new items

4. Testing Requirements:
   - Test similarity calculations
   - Test rating predictions
   - Test recommendation generation
   - Test with sparse data
   - Test edge cases:
     * New users
     * New items
     * Missing ratings
     * Invalid inputs

5. Performance Optimization:
   - Optimize similarity computations
   - Handle large datasets efficiently
   - Implement caching if needed
   - Profile and improve performance

6. Integration:
   - Integrate with data loading system
   - Ensure compatibility with future components
   - Maintain clean interfaces

Evaluation Criteria:
1. Prediction accuracy
2. Code quality and organization
3. Performance with large datasets
4. Test coverage
5. Documentation quality

Deliverables:
1. CollaborativeFiltering class implementation
2. Comprehensive test suite
3. Performance analysis
4. Integration with existing components
5. Documentation and examples
