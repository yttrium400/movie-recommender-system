Sprint 3: Web Interface Implementation

Objective:
Create a user-friendly web interface for the movie recommender system that allows users to browse movies, rate them, and receive personalized recommendations.

Requirements:

1. Backend Development:
   - Implement a FastAPI web service:
     * RESTful API endpoints for:
       - User management (signup, login)
       - Movie browsing and search
       - Rating submission
       - Recommendation retrieval
     * Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
     * Error handling and validation
     * Rate limiting for API endpoints

2. Frontend Development:
   - Create a modern React-based UI:
     * Responsive design using Material-UI/Tailwind
     * Movie browsing with infinite scroll
     * Search functionality with filters
     * Rating interface (5-star system)
     * User profile management
   - Implement features:
     * Movie details view
     * Personal rating history
     * Recommendation display
     * Similar movies section

3. User Features:
   - Authentication system:
     * User registration
     * Login/logout
     * Password reset
   - User preferences:
     * Favorite genres
     * Rating history
     * Recommendation preferences
   - Social features:
     * Share recommendations
     * Movie lists/collections
     * Rating comments

4. Integration:
   - Connect with recommender system:
     * Real-time recommendations
     * Batch processing for heavy computations
     * Caching for performance
   - Database integration:
     * User data storage
     * Rating history
     * Movie information
   - API security:
     * JWT authentication
     * Input validation
     * CORS configuration

5. Testing:
   - Frontend testing:
     * Component tests
     * Integration tests
     * E2E tests with Cypress
   - Backend testing:
     * API endpoint tests
     * Authentication tests
     * Load testing
   - Cross-browser testing
   - Mobile responsiveness testing

6. Documentation:
   - API documentation:
     * Endpoint descriptions
     * Request/response examples
     * Authentication guide
   - User documentation:
     * User guide
     * Feature tutorials
     * FAQ section
   - Developer documentation:
     * Setup guide
     * Architecture overview
     * Contribution guidelines
