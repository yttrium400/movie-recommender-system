Sprint 4: Hybrid Recommender System

Objective:
Combine collaborative filtering and content-based approaches into a hybrid recommender system for improved recommendations.

Requirements:

1. Hybrid Recommender Core:
   - Implement a HybridRecommender class with methods:
     * __init__(self, weights={'collaborative': 0.6, 'content': 0.4}): Initialize with component weights
     * fit(self, movies_data, ratings_data): Train both recommenders
     * predict(self, user_id, movie_id): Get weighted prediction
     * recommend_movies(self, user_id, n=5): Get hybrid recommendations

2. Integration Components:
   - Combine predictions from both systems:
     * Weight predictions appropriately
     * Handle missing predictions
     * Normalize scores across methods
   - Handle cold start problems:
     * New users (favor content-based)
     * New items (favor content-based)
     * Sparse ratings (adjust weights)

3. Advanced Features:
   - Implement adaptive weighting:
     * Based on user rating count
     * Based on item popularity
     * Based on prediction confidence
   - Add explanation generation:
     * Why items were recommended
     * Which method contributed more
     * Similar items/users considered

4. Testing Requirements:
   - Test hybrid recommendations
   - Test weight combinations
   - Test cold start handling
   - Compare with individual methods
   - Verify explanation generation

5. Performance Optimization:
   - Optimize prediction speed
   - Implement caching
   - Handle large-scale recommendations
   - Profile memory usage

6. API and Interface:
   - Create clean API for recommendations
   - Add configuration options
   - Implement progress tracking
   - Add recommendation explanations

Evaluation Criteria:
1. Recommendation quality
2. Cold start handling
3. Performance and scalability
4. Code quality and organization
5. Documentation and usability

Deliverables:
1. HybridRecommender implementation
2. Integration with existing components
3. Comprehensive test suite
4. Performance analysis
5. API documentation
6. Usage examples
