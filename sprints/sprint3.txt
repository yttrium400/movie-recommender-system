Sprint 3: Content-Based Filtering Implementation

Objective:
Implement a content-based filtering system that recommends movies based on their features (genres, tags, etc.).

Requirements:

1. Feature Engineering:
   - Extract and process movie features from the available data (genres, tags)
   - Create a feature matrix for movies using:
     * One-hot encoded genres
     * TF-IDF vectors for movie tags/descriptions
   - Normalize feature vectors appropriately

2. Content-Based Recommender:
   - Implement a ContentBasedFiltering class with methods:
     * __init__(self): Initialize the recommender
     * fit(self, movies_data): Process and store movie features
     * get_movie_features(self, movie_id): Return processed features for a movie
     * get_similar_movies(self, movie_id, n=5): Find similar movies based on features
     * recommend_movies(self, user_id, n=5): Recommend movies based on user's rating history

3. Similarity Metrics:
   - Implement cosine similarity for comparing movie feature vectors
   - (Optional) Add support for other similarity metrics (Euclidean, Pearson)

4. Testing Requirements:
   - Test feature extraction and processing
   - Test similarity calculations
   - Test movie recommendations
   - Handle edge cases (new movies, missing features)
   - Verify recommendation quality

5. Integration:
   - Ensure compatibility with existing collaborative filtering system
   - Handle cold start problems for new movies
   - Optimize performance for large datasets

Evaluation Criteria:
1. Code quality and documentation
2. Test coverage and robustness
3. Recommendation quality
4. Performance with large datasets
5. Integration with existing system

Deliverables:
1. ContentBasedFiltering class implementation
2. Comprehensive test suite
3. Documentation and examples
4. Performance analysis
