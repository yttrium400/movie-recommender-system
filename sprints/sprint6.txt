Sprint 5: Evaluation and Deployment

Objective:
Evaluate the recommender system's performance, optimize it, and prepare for deployment with a user interface.

Requirements:

1. Evaluation Framework:
   - Implement evaluation metrics:
     * Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
     * Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
     * Precision and Recall
     * Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)
   - Cross-validation setup:
     * Time-based splitting
     * User-based splitting
     * Hold-out validation

2. Performance Analysis:
   - Benchmark different approaches:
     * Collaborative filtering
     * Content-based filtering
     * Hybrid recommendations
   - Analyze:
     * Prediction accuracy
     * Coverage
     * Diversity
     * Novelty
     * Scalability

3. Web Interface:
   - Implement a Flask/FastAPI web service:
     * RESTful API endpoints
     * Swagger documentation
     * Rate limiting
     * Error handling
   - Create a simple web interface:
     * User authentication
     * Movie search
     * Rating submission
     * Recommendation display
     * Explanation viewing

4. Optimization:
   - Model optimization:
     * Parameter tuning
     * Algorithm efficiency
     * Memory usage
   - System optimization:
     * Caching
     * Batch processing
     * Asynchronous operations

5. Deployment Preparation:

     * API documentation
     * User guide
     * Developer guide
   - Testing:
     * Unit tests
     * Integration tests
     * Load tests
   - Containerization:
     * Docker setup
     * Docker Compose
     * Environment configuration

6. Monitoring and Maintenance:
   - Implement logging:
     * Performance metrics
     * Error tracking
     * Usage statistics
   - Add monitoring:
     * System health
     * Model performance
     * User feedback
