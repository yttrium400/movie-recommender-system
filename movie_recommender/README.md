# Movie Recommender System

A sophisticated movie recommendation system that uses multiple recommendation techniques to provide personalized movie suggestions to users.

## Features

- Collaborative Filtering (User-based and Item-based)
- Content-based Filtering using movie metadata
- Matrix Factorization techniques (SVD, NMF)
- Interactive Streamlit UI
- Real-time recommendations
